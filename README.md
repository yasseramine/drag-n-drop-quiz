# C - Variables, if, else, while
#### This project was done during ***The Software Engineering Program*** at "ALX".

## What to learn from this project :
+ What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
+ What are the logical operators (sometimes called boolean operators) and how to use them
+ What the the relational operators and how to use them
+ What values are considered TRUE and FALSE in C
+ What are the boolean operators and how to use them
+ How to use the `if`, `if ... else` statements
+ How to use comments
+ How to declare variables of types `char`, `int`, `unsigned int`
+ How to assign values to variables
+ How to print the values of variables of type `char`, `int`, `unsigned int` with `printf`
+ How to use the `while` loop
+ How to use variables with the `while` loop
+ How to print variables using `printf`
+ What is the `ASCII` character set
+ What are the purpose of the `gcc` flags `-m32` and `-m64`

## Requirements

+ Editor : vi, vim or emacs.
+ C Compiler : `gcc` on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
+ Conding style : **Betty Style**

## Tasks
Every file represents a single task :

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-positive_or_negative.c` | Prints the number (randomly generated with this [code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.c/blob/master/1-last_digit_c)) followed by `is positive` if the number is greater than 0, `is zero` if the number is zero, or `is negative` if the number is less than 0. |
| `1-last_digit.c` | Prints the string `Last digit of` number (randomly generated with this [code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.c/blob/master/1-last_digit_c)) `is` [last_digit] `and is` followed by `greater than 5` if the digit is greater than 5, `0` if the digit is 0, or `less than 6 and not 0` if the digit is less than 6 and not 0. |
| `2-print_alphabet.c`| C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function exactly twice. |
| `3-print_alphabets.c` | C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, then in uppercase, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function exactly three times. |
| `4-print_alphabt.c`| C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase except for the letters `q` and `e`, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function exactly twice. |
| `5-print_numbers.c` | C program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line. |
| `6-print_numberz.c` | C program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function exactly twice without any variables of type `char`. |
| `7-print_tebahpla.c` | C program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function exactly twice. |
| `8-print_base16.c` | C program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function exactly three times. |
| `9-print_comb.c` | C program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers, using only the `putchar` function exactly four times without any variables of type `char`: <ul><li>Numbers are separated by `,` followed by a space.</li><li>Numbers are printed in ascending order.</li></ul> |
| `10-print_comb2.c` | C program that prints the numbers from `00` to `99` using only the `putchar` function exactly five times without any variables of type `char`: <ul><li>Numbers are separated by `,` followed by a space.</li><li>Numbers are printed in ascending order, with two digits.</li></ul> |
| `100-print_comb3.c` | C program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits using only the `putchar` function exactly five times without any variables of type `char`: <ul>Numbers are separated by `,` followed by a space.</li><li>The two digits are different.</li><li>`01` and `10` are considered the same combination of the two digits `0` and `1`.</li><li>Prints only the smallest combination of two digits.</li><li>Numbers are printed in ascending order.</li></ul> |
| `101-print_comb4.c` | C program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits using only the `putchar` function exactly six times without any variables of type `char`: <ul>Numbers are separated by `,` followed by a space.</li><li>The three digits are different.</li><li>`012`, `120`, `102`, `021`, `201` and `210` are considered the same combination of the three digits `0`, `1` and `2`.</li><li>Prints only the smallest combination of three digits.</li><li>Numbers are printed in ascending order.</li></ul> |
| `102-print_comb5.c` | C program that prints all possible combinations of two-digit numbers using only the `putchar` function exactly eight times without any variables of type `char`: <ul>Numbers range from `0` to `99`.</li><li>Two numbers are separated by a space.</li><li>Numbers are printed with two digits [ie. `1` is printed as `01`].</li><li>`00 01` and `01 00` are considered the same as the combination of of the numbers `0` and `1`.</li><li>Combinations of numbers are separated by `,` followed by a space.</li><li>Combinations of numbers are printed in ascending order.</li></ul> |
